# macOS 10.11+ (El Capitan) introduced a feature in Terminal.app
# that stores per-tab session histories in a $HOME/.bash_sessions/ directory.
# This "helpful" feature is meant to disable itself when `histappend` is on
# (as I do in index.bash), but reality disagrees. The files are still being
# created and populated for every tab.
#
# Use ths $HOME/.bash_sessions_disable mechanism instead.
